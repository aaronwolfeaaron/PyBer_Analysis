# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
This analysis was conducted to observe the differences in fare amongst rural, suburban, and urban cities served by PyBer. In particular, PyBer sought to find disparities in access to rideshares based on affordability by location. 

# Results

After analysis, the data showed that users in rural areas paid significantly more per ride than their suburban and urban counterparts, with urban riders paying the least per ride. There are multiple factors noted of why this may be the case. 

For one, there are far less drivers in rural areas than urban areas, so this comes down to an issue of supply-and-demand. A random sampling shown below shows evident disparities in number of drivers.
